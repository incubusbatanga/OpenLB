OpenLB's network utility functions. Included through API base object.

Exports the following methods:

set_nonblocking(fd)

    Puts file descriptor fd into non blocking mode.

is_ipv4(address)

    Verifies if given address string represents IPv4 address or prefix.

is_ipv6(address)

    Verifies if given address string represents IPv6 address or prefix.

get_host_by_name(host, address_family)

    Resolves host into IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on the requested

    same value that was passed.
